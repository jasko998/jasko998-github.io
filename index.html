      <h2>More facts about Arizona</h2>
          <p>
            Arizona's name may have come from an early Arizona explorer of Spanish descent, 
            Juan Bautista de Anza, who may have called it “place of oaks,” or from Papago Native American words that translate to “place of the young spring.”
            About five million people visit the state's nickname each year: the 277-mile-long Grand Canyon.
